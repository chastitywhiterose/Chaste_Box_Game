I have been able to compile my SDL programs flawlessly on Linux.
I always use the following command:

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lm && ./main

Everything works on Linux because I installed SDL through the package manager and all dependencies are included.

But on Windows things get a little bit more tricky. Windows does not operate as a development environment the same way at all. Here is what I did in order to get it running on Windows 10 for my own convenience when compiling SDL programs for Windows after I have already finished developing them on Linux.

My first method was installing msys2 and then installing all required tools through the pacman package manager. It was not too hard and it does indeed work at getting my SDL programs compiled. But I was looking for something a little bit more minimalistic.

First I installed mingw-w64 to get a working modern version of the gcc compiler.

The website with a lot of info is:
https://www.mingw-w64.org/

And where I downloaded from was here:
https://winlibs.com/

Specifically the file at the time I got was 
"winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-12.2.0-mingw-w64ucrt-10.0.0-r4.zip"

So then I put the mingw64 folder in C:\

So my installation directory is C:\mingw64

So to set the required path when in a Windows command prompt, I run:

SET PATH=C:\mingw64\bin

This gives a working gcc compiler.

But I also downloaded the mingw development libraries for SDL. The file I downloaded was
"SDL2-devel-2.26.3-mingw.zip"

I have them installed at:
C:\SDL\SDL2-2.26.3\x86_64-w64-mingw32

This means that through one very long command, it is possible to compile and run my programs like this:

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main -IC:\SDL\SDL2-2.26.3\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2 -LC:\SDL\SDL2-2.26.3\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -mwindows && main

But in most cases I use a special script I wrote for my convenience. It is as follows.
------
SET COMPILER_PATH=C:\mingw64\bin
SET SDL_PATH=C:\SDL\SDL2-2.26.3\x86_64-w64-mingw32
SET PATH=%COMPILER_PATH%;%SDL_PATH%\bin

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main -I%SDL_PATH%\include\SDL2 -L%SDL_PATH%\lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -mwindows && main
------

My script solves the problem of not only setting the correct paths so compiling on Windows is possible, but it also sets the path to include where SDL2.dll is so that it is found when running the program. Of course the dll  must still be copied into the same folder as my finished project when I distribute it to other people.

And with all that work, my development environment for C with SDL on Windows is complete and I can use it faster than having to boot up msys2.

Also, this DOS/Windows command line guide is super helpful when learning how to use variables in scripts.

Update:

I downloaded "SDL2_mixer-devel-2.6.3-mingw.zip" because I my third game uses SDL2_mixer for audio.

I copied all the files from "x86_64-w64-mingw32" into the folder of the same name so that they would be in the same place as the development files already there. Then I added the "-lSDL2_mixer" flag to my compile command.

Now my compile script looks like this:

SET COMPILER_PATH=C:\mingw64\bin
SET SDL_PATH=C:\SDL\SDL2-2.26.3\x86_64-w64-mingw32
SET PATH=%COMPILER_PATH%;%SDL_PATH%\bin

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main -I%SDL_PATH%\include\SDL2 -L%SDL_PATH%\lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer -mwindows && main

It compiles fine but does not run without these files

SDL2.dll
SDL2_mixer.dll

Plus these dependencies fo SDL2_mixer

libmpg123-0.dll
libogg-0.dll
libopus-0.dll
libopusfile-0.dll

But since I already had all these files in my msys2 installation. I copied them over.
So the result is that I now have a batch file that I can double click and it will automatically compile and run the Windows version of the game without having to boot msys2 even though my msys2 installation was required to obtain the dependencies of SDL2_mixer.

This makes publishing new Windows versions of any SDL game I produce faster. I still do all development on Linux though.
